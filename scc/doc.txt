This document describes the expected behaviour of SCC (the Qt State Chart Compiler) in regards to SCXML tags and features.

SCXML
  Ignored: version, profile, exmode
    
STATE
  Ignored: src
  
TRANSITION
  Ignored: anchor
  Additional: Qt:animation, a location expression that points to a QPropertyAnimation* object
  Notes: An event in a transition translates to a Qt signal in the state machine object. "*" would occur on any event. Prefix matching is not supported, but * and done events are supported. 
        Conditions are C++ boolean expressions.
PARALLEL
  Ignored: src
  
HISTORY:
  Notes: The history's default transition cannot have executable content. 
  
LOG:
  Notes: the level of the log translates to QtMsgType. expr is a c++ expression.
  
SEND:
  Partially supported: target (only "_internal")
  Ignored attributes: type, idlocation, hints
  Notes: The target attribute can be either empty for a regular event, "_internal" for an internal-queue event, or a location expression to emit a signal in an object.

CANCEL:
  Notes: ID is a string literal, not an expression

DATA:
  Ignored attributes: src
  Additional: Qt:type, to define a C++ type for this data element
  Notes: A data element is converted to a Qt property of the state-machine object. expr/text are C++ expressions

ASSIGN:
  Notes: If dataid is present rather than location, the generated code would use the Qt property system to assign the value. expr is a c++ expression.
    
PARAM
  Notes: either name, expr or inline-text can appear, as the parameters are translated to a QVariantList.

SCRIPT
  Notes: raw C++ code
  
Fully supported:
  INITIAL, FINAL, ONENTRY, ONEXIT, IF, ELSEIF, ELSE, LOG, CANCEL, DATAMODEL

Unsupported:
    INVOKE, CONTENT, DONEDATA, FINALIZE, ANCHOR, VALIDATE
